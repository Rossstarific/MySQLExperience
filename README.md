# MySQLExperience
What I have written in MySQL as part of my Database Management Systems class.

Description of every file and their purpose:

Bank Database.sql: example database used for a homework exercise for the Database course, used in another file within this repository.

Homework 2 Queries.sql: A MySQL file that I wrote to perform several different queries on the previously mentioned Bank Database.
This is what was written for the homework assignment. The code was written with the intention that each query is it's own separate case,
meaning that it is HIGHLY recommended that said queries are not all run at once when testing. This is especially true with the queries that
modify the database (i.e. update and delete queries).

Ross Bollinger Homework 2.docx: A word document that serves as a write-up for the outputs of Homework 2 Queries.sql. It lists every
query along with screenshots of their outputs.

Ross Bollinger Database Proposal.docx: The proposal for the final project of the Database course. The objective of this project is to
create a small database that is based around a real-world field that said database could be used in (possible topics given by the professor
were things like health care, airlines, or banks). I have chosen to do a database for use by a professional theater.

Final Project Database: These files contain the SQL code for the database that I have fabricated proposed in the proposal, and multiple SQL queries I was required to make on said database as part of the final project. This also includes a write-up (Theatre Database Write-Up.docx) that explains the potential use for the database, as well as explanations for all of the entities within the database and their relationships. There is also an entity relationship diagram (ERD) made in Visual Paradigm for the database.

The files in the folder "CSC434WebD" contain the Cold Fusion code used to implement my theater database into a web based platform. This     website allows you to find, add, update, and delete theaters and update customers in the database. There is a report including             screenshots in the "Final Project Database" folder that shows the outcome of the functions of the web application.
